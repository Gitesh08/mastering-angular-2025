# Mastering Angular in 2025

Welcome to the **Mastering Angular in 2025** repository! This is your go-to spot for hands-on mini-projects tied to my Medium blog series, designed to help you level up your Angular skills. Whether you’re just starting out or you’re a seasoned dev looking to sharpen up, these projects break down key Angular concepts like components, lifecycle hooks, and component communication through practical, bite-sized apps. Each project lives in its own folder and matches a blog post in the series.


Dive in, play around, and let’s master Angular together!

More projects are coming as the series rolls on—stay tuned for Part 4!

## Getting Started

Each project is a standalone Angular app with its own setup. To run any project:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (v18 or higher)
   - Angular CLI. Install it globally with:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gitesh08/mastering-angular-2025.git
   cd mastering-angular-2025
   ```

3. **Navigate to a Project**:
   For example, to run the Task Tracker:
   ```bash
   cd part-3-task-tracker
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser (checked as of 9:06 PM IST, May 23, 2025).

Each project folder (e.g., `part-2-book-card/README.md` or `part-3-task-tracker/README.md`) has its own `README.md` with specific setup details.
