# Mastering Angular in 2025

Welcome to the **Mastering Angular in 2025** repository! This repository hosts mini-projects from my blog series on Medium, designed to help you learn Angular by building practical, modular web applications. Each project corresponds to a part of the series, covering key Angular concepts like components, lifecycle hooks, and more.

Whether you're new to Angular or an experienced developer, these projects offer hands-on practice to enhance your skills. Explore, experiment, and join me in mastering Angular!

## Projects

Below is a list of the mini-projects in this repository, each tied to a blog post:

- **Part 2: Book Card** (`part-2-book-card`)
  - A reusable Angular component that displays book details (title, author, publication year) in a styled card.
  - Features: Component creation, external CSS, lifecycle hooks (`ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngOnDestroy`).
  - Blog Post: [Part 2: Diving Deep into Angular Components](https://medium.com/@<your-medium-username>/<part-2-slug>)
  - Folder: `part-2-book-card`

More projects will be added as the series continues. Check back for Part 3 and beyond!

## Getting Started

Each project is a standalone Angular application with its own dependencies. To run any project:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (v18 or higher)
   - Angular CLI. Install globally with:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gitesh08/mastering-angular-2025.git
   cd mastering-angular-2025
   ```

3. **Navigate to a Project**:
   For example, to run the Book Card project:
   ```bash
   cd part-2-book-card
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Run the Project**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to view the project.

Refer to each project’s `README.md` (e.g., `part-2-book-card/README.md`) for specific instructions and details.
